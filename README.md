 A low-cost, digital RPM meter was build in order to determine the magnitude and direction of rotation of the reaction wheels.

## Year: 2016. 

## Description. 

A low-cost, digital RPM meter was build in order to determine the magnitude and direction of rotation of the reaction wheels.

## Real-time results. 

Angular speed of the reaction wheel after optical tachometer integration and validation.
