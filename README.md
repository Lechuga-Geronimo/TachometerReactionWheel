# Optical Tachometer Design for Reaction Wheel Angular Speed Control.
A low-cost, digital RPM meter was build in order to determine the magnitude and direction of rotation of the reaction wheels.

## Year: 2016. 

## Description. 

A low-cost, digital RPM meter was build in order to determine the magnitude and direction of rotation of the reaction wheels.

## Working principle.

## Optical sensor.

For this application, a low-cost CNY-70 Infrared (IR) sensor was used.

## Analog aconditioner circuit.

This circuit is in charge of providing the right measurement of every cycle of the reaction wheel. It includes an anti-bounce section.
